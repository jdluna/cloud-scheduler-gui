Comments from usability test
-------------------------------
- The font is too small.
- The font color of available amount of CPU and memory on information card and time zone information is difficult to see.
- Icon of existing reservation menu is not meaningful.
- “Search” menu should be changed to distinguish from “Search by name” easier.
- Should change the circle markers which represent to a group of marker to use the icon as same as
regular markers but bigger and still put number inside.
- Should have max range or guide for user about the number of CPU and memory that they can search. 
(Maybe use a hint (?) icon after the label of textbox.)
- Should have 2 mode of time format (12hrs/24hrs.) and let user can switch it because some user is
more familiar with 12hours format.
- Color of the reservation part on top right should be changed to another color which is different from
the site’s information card.
