Comments from usability test
-------------------------------
M The font is too small. Don't use smaller than 10pt. 
  The font size for available amount of CPU/memory on information card is too small                         [done! : information card]
M time zone information is difficult to see. Change color to orange                                         [done! : light blue color]
M time and date on information card is too small. Change to larger font and to orange color.                [done! : white color]
M Color of the reservation panel on top right should be changed to another color which is different from
 the site's information card. Try light grey. 
L Icon of existing reservation menu is not meaningful.
L "Search" menu should be changed to distinguish from "Search by name" easier.
L make markers  style consistent for a single marker or a group of markers, put number inside.
