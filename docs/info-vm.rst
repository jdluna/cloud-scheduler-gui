Using virtual machines
=============================

.. contents::

Introduction
---------------

This is a summary of using a virtual machine for cloude scheduler GUI
development and testing.  

Login
~~~~~~

To login to your virtual machine you will need to use ssh.  The virtual
machine FQDN (fully qualified host name) is given to you in email. ::

    ssh root@FQDN

You will be working in root account to be able to accesss the database and
GUI installations. 


Installed software
-------------------

Most of the software that you need is already installed and you will do your
updates in place. 

#. Cloud scheduler GUI is installed in 
  
   #. /var/www/html/cloud-scheduler

      This is the web interface

   #. /opt/cloud-scheduler

      Source code for cloud scheduler

MySQL database
------------------

The cloud scheduler uses MySQL database **pragma** on its backend. 
You will be able to access the database directly when needed. ::

  # mysql pragma
  
Making changes to GUI
-------------------
To make changes to the GUI, you will need to make your changes in /opt/scheduler and copy the application over to /var/www/html/cloud-scheduler as follows ::

   # cd /opt/cloud-scheduler/UI
   # npm run build-linux
   
After it completes a new file will be created at src/app/app.js ::

   # cp src/app/app.js /var/www/html/cloud-scheduler/
     
You can then view the changes using http://<FQDN>/cloud-scheduler.  To view the admin username and password, type::

   # cat ~/cloud-gui.login
   
During testing you may need a valid session id if you are testing from the browser.  E.g.

http://<FQDN>/cloud-scheduler/scripts/CreateReservation.py?sites_id=UCSD&session_id=A6H8SG&â€¦ 

To get session id ::

  # mysql pragma
  Reading table information for completion of table and column names
  You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A
  
  Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
