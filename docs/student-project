Create a new GUI interface for the cloud scheduler. 
The new interface shoudl be
	more intuitive 
	user-friendly
	modular and easily extensible to new format (for example. new type of resources or data collections)
	have map-based information about reservations and sites

Ussage patterns or interactions:

The interface should be used for answering questions similar to the following:
1. Make a reservation for the resources
	reserve a single virtual cluster on a single site
	single virtual cluser spannibg multiple sites
	multiple clusters or servers on multiple sites
	can specify options for a reservation such as:
		number of cpus,
		memory, 
		time start, 
		duration of reservation, 
		type of image, 
		network specifics (ent, ipop)
	have a flexible filter for the above options (relax some constrains)
	find optimal reservation (time, sites) with respect to user specifications and sites availability


2. View existing reservations
	by site (admin interface)
	by user (user interface)
	map and list of reservations
	status of each reservation 
	time remaining for a reservation

3. Admin interface (low priority)
	manage users, groups, access control
	manage sites, filters, options
