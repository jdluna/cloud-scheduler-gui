Running cloud-scheduler-gui with PCC script (demo)
-----------------------------------------------------
The following has been setup on your lima VMs and an extra VM at calit2

PCC script 'pcc-check-reservations.py' is in /opt/pcc

It can be run by hand

$ cd /opt/pcc
$ ./pcc-check-reservations.py

It will put log output in /var/log/pcc-check-reservations.log

But I usually run the script out of cron every 2 minutes but have it commented out by default on each VM:

# crontab -l
#*/2 * * * * cd /opt/pcc; /opt/python/bin/python /opt/pcc/pcc-check-reservations.py

For simplicity, you should only enable the cron script on one VM at a time.  
To enable, type 'crontab -e' and hit the 'x' key to erase the '#' and then ':wq' followed by enter to save.

Once cron is enabled on a site, go to the cloud scheduler GUI there and create a reservation.  You will also want to make
sure you have a real SSH key configured for the admin user to be able to log into the virtual cluster.
For demo purposes, you may want to alter the GUI to 

1) allow you to make a reservation for the current hour (rather than the next available hours) so that it will start right away
2) allow 0 CPUs to be specified in reservation (i.e. just boot a frontend and no compute nodes -- fastest)

Once the reservation is created, you should get an email confirmation (to email of user) within 2 minutes to confirm. 
Then you will receive email when it is started, running, and stopped.  The email notification for running should contain
the login info.  E.g.,

Dear Prapansak,

Your PRAGMA Cloud reservation has been updated.  Please see details below.

Reservation:

ID:          7
Title:       test
Description: test
Begin Time:  2017-05-17 07:00:00
End Time:    2017-05-17 10:00:00
VC Image:    rocks-basic

Sites (1):

  Site: UCSD cloud
    Status: running (was starting)
    CPUs:   2
    Memory: 4
    Admin notes:

    You may now log into the frontend.  E.g.,

    # ssh root@137.110.119.223
    
To verify you have capacity on the machine before your demo, you can run this command.  You should see only one VM running, calit2-119-222.

# ssh calit2-119-121.ucsd.edu /opt/pragma_boot/bin/pragma list cluster
FRONTEND         COMPUTE NODES  STATUS  PUBLIC IP
